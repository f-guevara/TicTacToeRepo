## How to Play

### Player vs Player

- **Start the Game**: The game will prompt you to choose between Player vs Player or Player vs AI.
- **Make a Move**: Players take turns entering the position (row and column) where they want to place their mark (X or O).
- **Winning the Game**: The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

### Player vs AI

- **Start the Game**: Select the Player vs AI option when prompted.
- **Player's Turn**: You make your move first, entering the row and column as in Player vs Player mode.
- **AI's Turn**: The AI will automatically make its move using a simple strategy.
- **Winning the Game**: As with Player vs Player, the goal is to get three marks in a row.

## Input Format

- Players will be asked to enter a number between 1 and 3 for row and column selection.
- The grid positions are as follows:

  ```scss
  (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3)
  ---------------------
  (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3)
  ---------------------
  (3,1) | (3,2) | (3,3)

## AI Strategy

The AI in this game is designed to be competitive but simple. It follows these basic strategies:

- **Win**: If the AI can win in its next move, it will.
- **Block**: If the player is about to win, the AI will block them.
- **Center Preference**: If the center spot is available, the AI will take it.
- **Corner Preference**: The AI prefers corners if the center is taken.
- **Random Choice**: If no strategic move is available, the AI will pick a random available spot.
